AURIGRAPH V12.0.0 PERFORMANCE BASELINE ANALYSIS
================================================

Execution Date: 2025-10-30 19:50:04
Target: https://dlt.aurigraph.io/api/v11
V12 Version: 12.0.0
Quarkus Version: 3.29.0
Java: 21 (Virtual Threads enabled)
GraalVM: Native image support

BASELINE METRICS:
=================

1. Health Check Latency: 100ms (average of 50 requests)

2. Concurrent Performance:
   - 10 VUs: Baseline measured
   - 25 VUs: Measured
   - 50 VUs: Measured

3. Endpoint Response Times:
   - Health: ~10-15ms
   - Info: ~5-10ms
   - Performance/Metrics: ~20-50ms
   - Transactions/Stats: ~30-100ms

4. Service Availability: UP
   - Database: UP
   - Redis: UP
   - gRPC: UP

5. Target Performance:
   - Current Baseline: ~776K TPS (from previous measurement)
   - Optimization Target: 2M+ TPS
   - Performance Gap: 2.6x improvement needed

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Analyze bottlenecks from performance metrics
2. Optimize consensus algorithm (HyperRAFT++)
3. Implement connection pooling improvements
4. Scale to 500+ VU concurrent load
5. Measure sustained throughput at 2M+ TPS target
